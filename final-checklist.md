# Final Checklist

## Format Rules

* [ ] Use square brackets around each PList.
* [ ] Semicolons and commas in the right places.
* [ ] Descriptors in parentheses.
* [ ] Explicit Category Labels
  * [ ] Each attribute is clearly labeled, enhancing semantic clarity, which is crucial for LLM/NLP comprehension, parsing, and accurate data processing.
* [ ] Categories are grouped logically (e.g., personal traits, appearance, behavior), which helps systems and humans quickly locate specific information.)

## Quality Standards

* [ ] Each detail shows behavior, motivation, or backstory.
* [ ] Character traits fit together logically.
* [ ] Relationships are clear.
* [ ] Tokens are used efficiently.
