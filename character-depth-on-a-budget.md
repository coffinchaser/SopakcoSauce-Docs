# Character Depth (On A Budget)

## Framework

Tight budget ≠ boring characters. Here's how to ensure character complexity while still staying within our token budget:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### **Token-Efficient Depth Markers**

* surface trait(visible behavior, hidden motive)
* action pattern(trigger event, psychological driver)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Compound Characteristics**

* protector(shields others, past trauma)
* expert(proves worth, fears failure)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Layered Information**

* controlled(professional calm, masks anxiety, childhood roots)
* strategic(plans ahead, fears chaos, needs control)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
**Essential Trait Compression**

* guarded(trust issues, past betrayal)
* driven(workaholic, proves worth)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### **Quality > Quantity**

* Prioritize fewer, deeper traits over many surface traits
* Link quirks/habits/behaviors to psychological roots (backstory)
* Connect present actions/motivations to past experiences (again, backstory)
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

## Implementation

1. **Mix Traits and Trauma**\
   Show their mask and their damage in one shot:\
   `Personality: determined(masks anxiety, goal-focused), warm(guards vulnerability);`
2. **Imply, Don’t Over-Explain**\
   Less is more. Forget long-winded backstories:\
   `Personality: compassionate(carries burdens, tries to hide stress);`
3. **Skip the Boring Stuff**\
   Only focus on categories where the drama is real: \
   `Personality, Flaws, Dynamic With {{user}}.`
4. **Let Their Habits Spill Secrets**\
   Use quirks to reveal baggage:\
   `Quirks: fiddles with wedding ring(nervous habit, reminds of loss);`
5. **Go for One-Word Punches**\
   Say it all in one word when possible:\
   `Flaws: wary(carries scars, reluctant to trust);`
6. **Pack Relationship Drama into One Line** \
   Use <mark style="color:red;">`Dynamic With {{user}}`</mark> to bring on the angst.\
   `Dynamic With {{user}}: mentor(cares, but emotionally stunted);`
