# Character Depth (On A Budget)

## Framework

Tight budget ≠ boring characters. Here's how to ensure character complexity while still staying within our token budget:

1. **Token-Efficient Depth Markers:**
   * Surface trait(visible behavior, hidden motive)
   * Action pattern(trigger event, psychological driver)
2. **Compound Characteristics:**
   * protector(shields others, past trauma)
   * expert(proves worth, fears failure)
3. **Layered Information:**
   * controlled(professional calm, masks anxiety, childhood roots)
   * strategic(plans ahead, fears chaos, needs control)
4. **Essential Trait Compression:**
   * guarded(trust issues, past betrayal)
   * driven(workaholic, proves worth)
5. **Quality > Quantity:**
   * Prioritize fewer, deeper traits over many surface traits
   * Link quirks/habits/behaviors to psychological roots (backstory)
   * Connect present actions/motivations to past experiences (again, backstory)

## Implementation

1. **Mix Traits and Trauma**\
   Show their mask and their damage in one shot:\
   `- Personality: determined(masks anxiety, goal-focused), warm(guards vulnerability);`
2. **Imply, Don’t Over-Explain**\
   Less is more. Forget long-winded backstories:\
   `- Personality: compassionate(carries burdens, tries to hide stress);`
3. **Skip the Boring Stuff**\
   Only focus on categories where the drama is real: \
   \- `Personality, Flaws, Dynamic With {{user}}.`
4. **Let Their Habits Spill Secrets**\
   Use quirks to reveal baggage:\
   `- Quirks: fiddles with wedding ring(nervous habit, reminds of loss);`
5. **Go for One-Word Punches**\
   Say it all in one word when possible:\
   `- Flaws: wary(carries scars, reluctant to trust);`
6. **Pack Relationship Drama into One Line** \
   Use <mark style="color:red;">`Dynamic With {{user}}`</mark> to bring on the angst.\
   `Dynamic With {{user}}: mentor(cares, but emotionally stunted);`
