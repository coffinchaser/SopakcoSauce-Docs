# Traits & Descriptors

## Traits

**Traits** are the core characteristics or qualities that define a character's personality, behavior, or nature. They're like the main ingredients in a recipe.

Traits answer the question: "What is this character like at their core?"

Think of traits as single-word or short-phrase labels that identify something fundamental about a character:

* brave
* intelligent
* short-tempered
* creative
* anxious
* loyal

### Find the Important Traits

Read your character description and underline the key personality traits, behaviors, and motivations.

**Example:**

> Sara is always the first to volunteer when someone needs help. She stays up late making care packages and remembers everyone's birthdays. This generous nature comes from growing up poor, when neighbors helped her family survive.

Underlined traits:

* Volunteers first
* Makes care packages
* Remembers birthdays
* Generous
* Background of poverty
* Values community help
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Convert Each Trait to PList Format

For each trait you identified, create a simple trait(behavior, reason) structure.

* generous(first to volunteer, remembers birthdays)

**Example conversions:**

* caring(makes packages, stays up late)
* background(grew up poor, received community help)
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Group Similar Traits Together

Combine related traits under common categories and format according to PList rules.

**Final PList format:**

```
Personality: generous(first to volunteer, remembers birthdays), caring(makes packages, stays up late);
Background: poverty(grew up poor, received community help)
```
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Before & After Examples

#### Example 1: The Nervous Student

**Before (Prose):**

> Alex always sits at the back of the classroom, hood pulled up and eyes down. He's brilliant but rarely speaks up, and when called on, his voice shakes. Years of being mocked for his stutter have made him afraid to participate, even though he usually knows the answers.

**After (PList):**

```
Personality: shy(sits at back, eyes down);
Speech: quiet(rarely speaks up, voice shakes when called on);
Flaws: insecure(hides knowledge, fear of mockery);
Background: bullied(for stutter, school trauma);
Strengths: intelligent(knows answers, understands material)
```

#### Example 2: The Tough Leader

**Before (Prose):**

> Despite her small stature, Commander Reyes dominates every room she enters. Her soldiers both fear and respect her, as she pushes them to their limits but never asks more than she herself would give. The scar across her face reminds everyone of the mission where she carried three wounded men to safety despite her own injuries. She rarely smiles, saving her rare moments of warmth for private conversations with those who've earned her trust.

**After (PList):**

```
Appearance: small stature(deceptive, contrasts authority), facial scar(from rescue mission, visible reminder);
Personality: commanding(dominates rooms, inspires fear/respect);
Leadership: demanding(pushes limits, leads by example);
Background: heroic(rescued wounded, despite injuries);
Expression: serious(rarely smiles, reserved warmth);
Dynamic with others: selective trust(private warmth, must be earned)
```

### TL;DR

1. **Focus on behaviors, not labels**
   * Instead of "kind," write "kind(helps strangers, gives compliments)"
2. **Include the "why" whenever possible**
   * Add reasons: "afraid of water(nearly drowned, childhood incident)"
3. **Keep it short but meaningful**
   * Aim for 2-3 descriptors per trait
4. **Connect traits to backstory**
   * Show origins: "distrusts authority(corrupt police, hometown experience)"
5. **Balance strengths and weaknesses**
   * Show complexity: "confident(in public, hides insecurities)"

### Stuck?

Ask yourself how you can fit a character's trait into this format:

```
what they are(how they show it, why they're like that)
```

Examples:

* protective(stands between danger and loved ones, couldn't save sister)
* perfectionist(triple-checks work, fears criticism)
* funny(uses humor in tense moments, deflects from serious topics)

### Practice

Convert this paragraph into PList format:

> Thomas checks his watch constantly and arrives everywhere twenty minutes early. This punctuality stems from his military father's strict discipline‚Äîbeing late meant punishment. While his preparation makes him reliable in a crisis, his friends find it frustrating when he rushes them or seems anxious about minor delays.

Try it yourself before checking the example answer below.

<details>

<summary>Answer</summary>

```
Personality: punctual(checks watch constantly, arrives early);
Background: strict father(military discipline, punished lateness);
Strengths: reliable(prepared, handles crises);
Flaws: anxious(about delays, rushes others);
Dynamic with friends: frustrating(time obsession, inflexible);
```

</details>

## Descriptors

Descriptors in PLists are **short, functional details** that clarify traits, actions, or beliefs. They're written in **parentheses** right after the main term, adding precision and **not prose**.

### **How to Write Descriptors**

1. **Use parentheses `( )`** after each trait or action.
   * `voice(low)` ‚Üí ‚Äúvoice‚Äù is the trait, ‚Äúlow‚Äù is the descriptor.
2. **Keep them literal and short.**
   * ‚úÖ `smile(flat, slow)`
   * ‚ùå `mouth(tight like a locked vault)`
3. **Separate multiple descriptors with commas.**
   * `stance(relaxed, open, ready)`
4. **Avoid repeating the trait in the descriptor.**
   * ‚ùå `obsessive(obsessive, very obsessed)`
   * ‚úÖ `aggressive(blunt, forceful)`
5. **Make descriptors useful, not decorative.**
   * **üòê** `build(beefy, muscular, strong)`
   * ‚úÖ `build(burly, dense muscle, broad shoulders)`

### Breaking Down Complex Ideas

Think of it like summarizing the purpose or effect of a detail and not the full story.

Use this approach:

1. Distill the core idea
2. Cut unnecessary backstory
   1. _Write a note to yourself to supplement any necessary details later during the writing of Example Dialogs._
3. Label the emotion or belief clearly
4. Split details across multiple fields if needed

#### 1. Distill the Core Idea

Take long descriptions and turn them into **compressed, behavior-based notes**.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Prose" %}
> ‚ÄúTaylor always acted friendly in public, but privately avoided real connection. She kept people close only when it benefited her.‚Äù
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="PList" %}
```txt
relationships(surface-level, self-serving, emotionally distant)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### 2. Summarize Time Without Writing a Timeline

Don‚Äôt explain what happened year by year. Just name the **cause and effect**.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Prose" %}
> ‚ÄúHe started volunteering to make up for how aimless he felt after college.‚Äù
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="PList" %}
```txt
volunteering(purpose-seeking, post-grad uncertainty)
```

Or:

```txt
motivation(avoidance of aimlessness, desire for direction)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### 3. Name the Emotion or Theme

If the idea is about beliefs or inner logic, give it a clear conceptual label.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Prose" %}
> ‚ÄúShe believes success is only real if others recognize it. Without praise, she feels like a failure.‚Äù
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="PList" %}
```txt
validation(external only, tied to achievement)
```

Or:

```txt
success(dependent on praise, internally hollow)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### 4. **Split Big Ideas into Multiple Fields**

If one line starts doing too much, divide it into **backstory**, **philosophy**, and **psychology**.

**Example:**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Prose" %}
> Jordan was homeschooled in a rigid, perfectionist household. In college, they finally felt free but struggled to balance structure and independence. They now over-plan everything and feel guilty when they rest.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="PList" %}
```txt
BACKSTORY: homeschooled(strict routine, high parental standards), college(first taste of freedom, overwhelmed by choice);
PHILOSOPHY: freedom requires discipline, rest must be earned;
PSYCHOLOGY: guilt tied to rest, comfort in control, avoids unstructured time;
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
