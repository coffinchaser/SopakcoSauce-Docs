# Non-Human Character Templates

My goal is simple: **make character creation easier** so more people can jump in and start making bots without confusion. Having ready-to-use templates helps everyone get started quickly.

Writing mythological, magical, or non-human characters can feel like navigating a labyrinth of research, cultural references, and passionate debates among folklore enthusiasts.

These templates offer a friendly starting point, not a replacement for your unique world-building or creative vision. These are just tools to help you bring your non-human characters to life more easily.

Feel free to:

* Modify these templates to fit your story
* Add your own creative twists
* Use them as a foundation to build upon

If you have questions about these templates or need help, just message me in the [#questions](https://discord.gg/R53qbpKN) channel on [WyvernChat Discord](https://discord.gg/ahsECfV7).
