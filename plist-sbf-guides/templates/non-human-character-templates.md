# Non-Human Character Templates

I want to create templates for every species listed in WyvernChat's tag system.

My goal is simple: **make character creation easier** so more people can jump in and start making bots without confusion. Having ready-to-use templates helps everyone get started quickly.

If you have questions about these templates or need help, just message me in the [#questions](https://discord.gg/R53qbpKN) channel on [WyvernChat Discord](https://discord.gg/ahsECfV7).
