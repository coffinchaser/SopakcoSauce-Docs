### Important Caveats

1. Limited Direct Research: Much of the analysis of personality trait expression in LLMs comes from broader studies of model behavior rather than targeted research on character trait representation.
2. Evolving Field: Many observations are based on rapidly evolving technology, and newer models may exhibit different behaviors.
3. Proprietary Systems: Detailed technical information about commercial LLMs is often limited due to proprietary restrictions.

### Suggested Additional Research Areas

1. Longitudinal studies of trait consistency in LLM interactions
2. Cross-model comparative analysis of personality expression
3. Quantitative metrics for measuring trait exaggeration
4. Cultural variation in trait interpretation and expression

Note: Due to the rapid development of AI technology, researchers should refer to the most recent publications and updates in this field.
